Tableau Citibike Project

This GitHub project contains the Tableau workbook and Readme file for this homework assignment.
The Tableau public workbook can be found at:
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.f.spring/viz/CitibikeTableauProjectworkbook/CitibikeUsageduringPandemicpg_1

The workbook has 9 worksheets (visualizations), 4 dashboard views that were used for the 4 page story.
Data that was analyzed covered February 2020 through January 2021 (peak time period for the Covid-19 Pandemic). Months were added to the files to supplement the information. 

Key findings:
- Ridership was high for male ridership compared to female ridership.   
- A high number of Departures and Arrivals around the Jersey City zip codes.
- Ridership increased across the months studied as commuters moved away from public transit and weather improved.
- There is potential for equipment to not rotate enough through the system.  Some bikes had high mileage and others had low mileage.
