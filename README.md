This workbook has 9 worksheets (visualizations), 4 dashboard views that were used for the 4 page story.
Data that was analyzed covered February 2020 through January 2021 (peak time period for the Covid-19 Pandemic). Months were added to the files to supplement the information.

Key findings:
1.) Ridership was high for male ridership compared to female ridership.   
2.) A high number of Departures and Arrivals around the Jersey City zip codes.
3.) Ridership increased across the months studied as commuters moved away from public transit and weather improved.
4.) There is potential for equipment to not rotate enough through the system.  Some bikes had high mileage and others had low mileage.
